# datatables-django-widget

[DataTables](https://datatables.net/) is an excellent JS library for displaying tabular data, and its [Editor](https://editor.datatables.net/) plugin provides tabular editing.

We have encapsulated this into a Django widget, to allow easy editing of Postgres' [ArrayField](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/contrib/postgres/fields/#arrayfield).

The specific implementation, and feature-set, we have created for this widget may not suit your needs perfectly, but this repo may serve as a useful reference point for your own implementations.
